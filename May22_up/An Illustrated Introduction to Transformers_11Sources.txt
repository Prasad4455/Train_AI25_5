Welcome to the Deep Dive. Today we're really getting into large language models, LLMs, and that incredible transformer architecture that, well, makes so many of them tick. Yeah, the goal here is to sort of demystify these really powerful AI tools. Get past the jargon. Exactly. Think of this as your guide to what's actually happening under the hood. We want you to get the core ideas, you know, quickly but properly without feeling totally lost. Right. And we've pulled together some great material. We've got stuff from Google.

2
Google for developers. A really neat visual explainer from the Polo Club of Data Science. Oh yeah, that one's good. Geeks for Geeks doing comparisons. Research AI multiple looking ahead. 3Blue1Brown making it visual. Sebastian Raschka on the coding side. And even some Reddit discussions for a different angle. So a real mix. The good mix, yeah. She gives a solid picture. Okay, let's jump right in. The big question first. What is a large language model, really? Well, Google defines it pretty clearly. At its core,

3
it's a machine learning model. Its job is predicting and generating language that, well, sounds like something a human might say. Like a super powered autocomplete. That's a great way to think about it, yeah. But on a massive scale, the key thing they do is estimate the probability, the chance of what comes next in a sequence. Could be the next word, sentence, even a whole paragraph. Okay, so predicting sequences. And that lets them do things like generate text, translate. Exactly. Translation,

4
question answering, summarizing text. Lots of applications. Google mentions those specifically. And the large part, that's grown over time, right? Massively. Google points out that early models maybe just predicted one word ahead. Now, with way more computing power, unbelievable amounts of data, and frankly just better modeling techniques. Modern LLMs can handle much longer stretches of text. And they sound coherent doing it. Increasingly so, yes. That term large is definitely relative and it's just exploded recently.

5
Right. Okay, so these powerful predictors, how do they work? That brings us to the transformer, doesn't it? Absolutely. The transformer architecture is pretty much the state-of-the-art foundation for, well, many of the LLMs making headlines. And it didn't start out trying to be chat GBT, did it? No. Interestingly, both Google and 3Blue1Brown highlight its original purpose was actually machine translation. Taking something like I am a good dog in English and turning it into je suis un bouchon in French.

6
That was the original task. Quite elite from translating sentences about dogs to writing essays. It is. But the core function, as 3Blue1Brown explains it, is still about prediction. Taking some input, usually text, but maybe images or sound, too, and predicting the next bit of text. And it doesn't just pick one next word, right? It's more probabilities. Exactly. The output isn't a single word. It's a probability distribution. It gives a likelihood score across all the possible next tokens. Tokens. Those are like the basic units.

7
Words, parts of words. Yeah. Could be words, subwords, even characters sometimes. So the model gives you odds for each possible next piece. Okay. So it gives this list of possibilities, ranked by probability. And then to write a whole paragraph, it just picks one, adds it, and does it all over again. That's the amazing part. It repeatedly predicts the next token, samples one based on those probabilities, adds it to the sequence, and uses that new sequence to predict the next token. Wow. It sounds almost too simple to create something coherent. It does. But scale makes sense.

8
It makes a huge difference. Like 3Blue1Brown points out, you look at the difference between, say, GPT-2, an earlier model, and something like GPT-3. Yeah. The jump in coherence is massive. Just from being bigger and having seen more data using this same prediction loop. Pretty much, yeah. That repeated prediction and sampling process scaled up is incredibly powerful. Okay, I think I've got the basics. LLMs predict text, often using transformers. Now let's unpack that transformer itself. How does it work?

9
Right. So the Pola Club of data science has this great breakdown. They say, think of it in three main stages. Embedding, then the transformer block, and finally output probabilities. Okay, stage one. Embedding. What's happening there? Embedding is all about turning text, which you means understand, into numbers, which the model understands. It's like translation. Translating words into math. Essentially, yeah. Pola Club says it involves a few steps. First, tokenization, breaking the text into those tokens we mentioned. Running.

10
Might become run, and alning, for example. Each gets a unique ID. Okay, like a dictionary look up for parts of words. GPT-2 had like 50,000 of these. Over 50,000, yeah. Then, token embedding. Each unique token ID gets mapped to a vector, basically a long list of numbers. A vector. Think of it as coordinates in a high dimensional space. This vector tries to capture the token's meaning. And these are high dimensional GPT-2, small, used 768 dimensions per token.

11
768 numbers just to represent one little piece of a word. Wow, where are all these numbers stored? In a huge table, essentially. A big embedding matrix. But that's just the meaning. We also need order. Right, because dog bites man is different from man bites dog. How does it know the order if it processes things kind of simultaneously? That's positional encoding. It adds more numbers to the embedding, specifically indicating the token's position in the sequence. First word, second word, and so on. So it learns the positions too. GPT-2 learns them, yes. So the final embedding is the sum of

12
the token's meaning vector and its position vector. Meaning plus position equals the final number representation. Exactly. And 3blue1brown is that neat analogy. These embeddings are like points in this meaning space. Words like king and queen might be close, but also related directionally to man and woman. So the geometry of this space actually captures relationships. Like woman-man plus king gets you close to queen. That kind of idea. That's the illustrative idea, yeah. It encodes semantic relationships.

13
Mathematically. Pretty cool. Okay, very cool. So now our text is a sequence of these rich number vectors. On to stage 2, the transformer block. Right, this is the real engine room. And you usually stack many of these blocks. A polo club points out two main parts inside each block. The attention mechanism and an MLP layer. Attention mechanism? Sounds crucial. Oh, it is. This is a big innovation of the transformer. Self-attention specifically. It's how the model figures out which words in the sentence are most relevant to understanding any other word.

14
So it helps with context? Like knowing which it refers to? Precisely. Geeks for Geeks says it weighs the importance of different input words when making predictions. Absolutely vital for context. How does it calculate that importance or attention? Okay, simplifying a bit. Sebastian Raschke and Polo Club explain that from each token's embedding, the model creates three new vectors. A query, a key, and a value. Query, key, value. Q, K, V. Okay. Think of the query as what a token is looking for.

15
The key is what information a token offers. The value is the actual content of the token. So the query asks the key answers if it's relevant, and the value is the information itself. That's a good way to think about it. The model compares the query of one token to the keys of all other tokens, usually using a dot product, to get attention scores. High score means high relevance. Like matching needs query to offerings key, as the Reddit discussion put it. Exactly. Then there's this scaling step. Dividing by the square root of the dimension of the keys.

16
Uh-oh, math. Why do they do that? Sebastian Raschke and others note it helps stabilize training. When dimensions get large, dot products can get huge. Making the next step? Softmax. Behave poorly. This scaling just keeps things in a good range. It's a bit of empirical magic that works. Okay, so scale the scores, then Softmax. We saw that before. Yep. Softmax turns those scaled scores into probabilities. So now each token has a set of probabilities saying how much attention

17
it should pay to every other token, including itself. So it knows which words are most important for understanding itself. Exactly. And these probability scores are then used to create a weighted sum of the value vectors. The higher the attention score between two tokens, the more the value of one influences the updated representation of the other. Okay, that makes sense. But then there's multi-head attention. Right. Instead of doing this QKV calculation just once, you do it multiple times in parallel with different learned QKV matrices. These are the heads.

18
Like getting multiple opinions. Kind of. Polo Club notes, GBT2 Small uses 12 heads. Each head can potentially learn to focus on different kinds of relationships. Maybe one head focuses on grammatical links, another on semantic similarity, etc. The Reddit analogy was a council of experts. Okay, so multiple perspectives combined. Makes sense. What happens after all that attention calculation? The outputs from all the heads are combined, processed a bit more, and then fed into the second part of the transformer block, the MLP layer.

19
MLP multi-layer perceptron. What's its job? It's a more standard feed-forward neural network. After attention has allowed tokens to gather context from each other, the MLP processes each token's representation independently. Refining it further. Exactly. Polo Club mentions it usually expands the dimensionality and then shrinks it back down, adding more processing capacity. Got it. Embedding transformer block, attention plus MLP, potentially repeated many times output probabilities. Stage 3. Yes. The final step.

20
After the stack of transformer blocks, we have these highly processed token embeddings. A final linear layer projects these into a huge vector space, as Polo Club describes. How huge. The size of the entire vocabulary. For GPT-2, that's over 50,000 dimensions. Each dimension corresponds to one possible token the model knows. And the output values are called logits. Right. 3Blue1Brown explains these are the raw, unnormalized scores for each token in the vocabulary.

21
So not probabilities yet. Not quite. You need one more Softmax step. Just like with the attention scores, Softmax converts these raw logits into a proper probability distribution over the entire vocabulary. And that tells us the probability of each possible word being the very next one. Precisely. That distribution is the model's final prediction for the next token. But does it always just pick the single highest probability word? Not necessarily. That would be very deterministic. Polo Club mentions temperature, a setting you can tweak.

22
Lower temperature means it sticks closely to the highest probabilities, making it more focused, but maybe repetitive. And higher temperature. More randomness. More creativity. Potentially less coherence. Let's it explore less likely options. There are also other sampling strategies, like TopGain or TopPak, which basically narrow the choices to a smaller set of the most likely tokens before picking one. Okay, that's a really deep look inside the transformer. Amazing stuff. Now, let's clarify something. We hear LLM and Transformer

23
used a lot. Are they the same thing? Geeks for Geeks says maybe not quite. Yeah, it's a good point to clarify. They're related but distinct. Geeks for Geeks explains it well. And LLM is the broad category and AI model trained on vast text data to understand and generate language. Think GPT-3, BERT, LAMA. They're defined by their scale, training data, and general language abilities. And often they use the transformer architecture. Very often, yes. The transformer, according to Geeks for Geeks, is the specific neural network architecture

24
designed for sequential data, famous for its self-attention mechanism and parallel processing. BERT and the GPT models are examples of models built using the transformer architecture. So, the transformer is the engine design, and the LLM is the whole car built around that engine, designed for driving on language roads. That's a decent analogy. The transformer architecture itself is actually versatile. It's been adapted for images, vision transformers or VATs, audio, etc. And LLM is specifically a language model, usually a very large one, that frequently

25
employs the transformer engine. OK, so purpose, architecture, scale, application, they differ. LLM is the language application. Transformer is the underlying tech. Got it. Geeks for Geeks summarizes the key differences nicely across those aspects. Right. Now, looking around us today and into the near future, what's the state of play with LLMs? What trends is research A-multiple seeing? Well, no surprise. The scaling continues. Research A-multiple points to models like GPT-4, CLAWD-3, LAMA-3 getting even bigger.

26
Pushing parameter counts higher, which generally boosts capability. Bigger is still seen as better, then. It seems to still yield results, yeah. They also note that performance on benchmarks is getting scarily close to human levels in some areas, not just language, but even things like reasoning and some types of image understanding. Wow, what else? Specialization is a big one. Fine-tuning models for specific domains. Research A-multiple mentions healthcare examples like MedPol M2 or Radiology Lama 2, but also law, science,

27
tailoring models to specific professional needs. Makes sense. A doctor might need different AI assistants than a lawyer. Exactly. And multimodality is huge. Models that don't just handle text, but images, audio, video, too. Think GPT-4 with vision or Google's Gemini. So, AI that can see and hear as well as read and write? That's the direction. Also importantly, improved safety mechanisms, trying to build in protocols to reduce bias and harmful outputs, like anthropic AIN-4 with CLAWD.

28
That's definitely crucial. Any wilder future predictions? Research A-multiple mentions sparse expert models. The idea is that instead of the whole giant network firing for every query, maybe only relevant expert parts activate. Could be more efficient, more specialized. OpenAI is apparently looking into this. Interesting. Like having specialists within the AI itself. Sort of, yeah. And deeper integration into how businesses work. Plus, this idea of models potentially self-improving by generating their own training data or correcting

29
their mistakes. Google's researching that, too. The pace is just incredible. But it's not all smooth sailing, is it? There are downsides, limitations. Definitely. We need to talk about those. Google Research A-multiple and the ACL Anthology's Ethics Guide all raise critical points. Cost is one. Training these massive models is incredibly expensive and needs huge resources. Both money and energy, right? Yes. The environmental impact is a real concern, as the ACL Anthology notes. Then there's bias. LLMs learn from data.

30
And if that data reflects societal biases around race, gender, religion, whatever the model can learn and amplify them. That's a huge problem. The Reddit discussion even touched on how attention might inadvertently learn bad correlations. Exactly. And while there are techniques to try and de-bias models, the ACL Anthology points out they have limitations. It's not a solved problem. And they sometimes just make stuff up, right? Hallucinations. Yes. Accuracy can be an issue.

31
So cost, bias, accuracy, and the big one, ethics. Absolutely central. Google and the ACL Anthology stress this. It's a minefield.

32
It requires careful thought. The ACL Anthology emphasizes the need for ethical considerations right from the start of development, using frameworks, thinking about who is affected, data providers, users, society, and involving them. So ethics isn't an add-on. It has to be baked in. Ideally, yes. From data preparation through deployment. They also mention the dual use problem. These powerful tools can be used for good or ill. OK, so we've covered a lot of ground. LLMs, transformers, how they work, where they're going, and the significant challenges.

33
Let's try to wrap this up. Key takeaways. I'd say LLMs are incredibly potent language tools. Transformer architecture with its self-attention is the key enabler for many. They're getting rapidly better. But they come with major costs, risks of bias and inaccuracy, and profound ethical questions that we absolutely must grapple with. So hopefully for you listening, this deep dive has armed you with a better understanding of the core tech. Beyond just the surface level excitement, you can see the mechanics and the implications now. Exactly.

34
And maybe that leaves us with a final thought for you to ponder. As these LLMs weave themselves more deeply into our lives, how do we collectively steer their development? How do we ensure they're built and used responsibly, ethically, maybe even equitably? Especially considering potentially vulnerable communities. What's our role as individuals in shaping this? It's a massive question. Maybe exploring some of those resources. Like the LLM ethics white paper from the ACL anthology. Could be a next step if you want to dig deeper.
